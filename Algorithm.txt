IF TurnOver() address is rounting_count and rounting[rounting_count] THEN
before TurnOver() 1 step address is rounting_count-1 

WHEN TurnOver() used we will change recoder FROM rounting_count-1 TO rounting_count

Data of rounting_count-1 Is by case after this\
IF prv_walk is 4 THEN
rounting[rounting_count-1] = TurnRight
ELSE IF prv_walk is 4 THEN
rounting[rounting_count-1] = TurnRight
ELSE IF prv_walk is 3 THEN
rounting[rounting_count-1] = Forward
ELSE IF prv_walk is 6 THEN
rounting[rounting_count-1] = TurnRight
ELSE IF prv_walk is 5 THEN
rounting[rounting_count-1] = Forward
